One day, Ali Baba had an easy puzzle that he couldn't solve. The puzzle consisted of 4
 numbers and his task was to check whether he could get the fourth number using arithmetic operators (+,−,×
) between the other three numbers; so that each operator is used only once.

, c
 and d
 (−109≤a,b,c≤109
),(−1018≤d≤1018
).
